## Fictoan boilerplate for React

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:
```bash
pnpm i && pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

#### What you need
1. **NodeJS**<br/>
    This is a Javascript “runtime”. React is a JS framework, so needs something like Node to run inside of. Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    
2. **Yarn**<br/>
    A package manager. This helps manage dependencies required by this project. Download from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
    
3. **A code editor**<br/>
    Someplace for you to type code. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a high-quality free and open-source editor.
    
4. **A terminal**<br/>
    The opposite of UI. We recommend [Hyper](https://hyper.is/). This is to run and manage your project. MacOS come with a built-in terminal called, um, Terminal. Windows has Command Prompt.
