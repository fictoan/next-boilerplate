# FICTOAN — React boilerplate
### v0.7.3
#### A nice little starter project in React to hit the ground running.

---

#### What you need
1. **NodeJS**

    This is a Javascript “runtime”. React is a JS framework, so needs something like Node to run inside of. Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    
2. **Yarn**
    
    A package manager. This helps manage dependencies required by this project. Download from [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
    
3. **A code editor**
    
    Someplace for you to type code. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a high-quality free and open-source editor.
    
4. **A terminal**
    
    The opposite of UI. We recommend [Hyper](https://hyper.is/). This is to run and manage your project. MacOS come with a built-in terminal called, um, Terminal. Windows has Command Prompt.
